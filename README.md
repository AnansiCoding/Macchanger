# Macchanger
Python program which allows you to choose which function you use from a list.

This is my first bit of code and is not pretty, but it is functional.
This program needs Macchanger and ifconfig to work.

The addressBin.py file needs input for both your wifi and ethernet names as my wifi and ethernet are not the standard wlan0 and eth0. As I currently don't know how to pull those names with python code at the moment I have a manual input.

If you have any sugestions for improvments please let me know.
I'd love to know your experiance with this simple program.
